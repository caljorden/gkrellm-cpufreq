Version 2.5   2019-05-20
===========
Makefile uses standard CC variable instead of custom CMD_CC.
Update only every pGK->second_tick () to reduce CPU load.
Use /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%d/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq instead of
/proc/cpuinfo because it is a) faster to parse and b) not x86-specific.
Display frequencies as 'x.xx GHz' instead of integer MHz.
